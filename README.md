### 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate developer who loves solving real-world problems through code. Whether it's a personal challenge, something my friends face, or a trend I notice online, I turn problems into working software. Most of my projects are built from scratch — from concept and planning to full deployment — with an emphasis on backend logic, performance, and practical value.

If you’ve got a problem you’d like solved with code, I’d love to hear about it. Reach out anytime at **amueller.code@gmail.com**.

  <summary><h3>📘 My Coding Journey</h3></summary>

Growing up in Silicon Valley, I was immersed in tech from a young age and quickly developed a love for programming. I started writing real code my freshman year of high school and haven’t stopped since.

Over the years, I’ve:
- Written hundreds of scripts and apps  
- Built and deployed full-stack web and backend systems  
- Worked extensively with machine learning models  
- Developed production-level tools and bots  

I'm excited by innovation, driven by impact, and always hungry to learn more. Whether it’s through side projects, academic work, or research — I’m constantly trying to grow as a developer and problem-solver.
