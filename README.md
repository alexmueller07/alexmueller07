### 🔍 About Me

I’m a software developer with a passion for building tools that solve real problems — not just hypothetical ones. From backend systems to full-stack apps and machine learning models, I thrive on designing solutions from the ground up. I don't just build projects — I **engineer value**.

Most of my work stems from a simple question:  
**“What would make life easier for someone right now?”**  
Whether it’s a tool for friends, a solution to a personal inefficiency, or an idea sparked by something I see online, I love turning insight into action.

📨 Have a challenge worth solving? I’d love to hear it: **amueller.code@gmail.com**

  <summary><h3>📘 My Journey into Code</h3></summary>

I was raised in Silicon Valley, where I was exposed to software engineering at a young age. What started as a curiosity became a lifelong passion. I began programming seriously during my freshman year of high school, and haven’t stopped since.

Over the years, I've:
- Written hundreds of projects and tools — from bots and APIs to full-stack apps
- Learned how to think like an engineer, not just a coder
- Taught myself to independently research, architect, and ship solutions
- Released production-ready tools used by real people

Coding isn’t just something I do — it’s how I think, create, and solve problems.
